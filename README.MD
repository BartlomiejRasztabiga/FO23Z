Julia sets, named after the French mathematician Gaston Julia, are a type of fractal that is created by iterating a complex function. The visualization of Julia sets is both a mathematical and an artistic endeavor. Here's a brief explanation of how they work:

1. **Choice of a Complex Function:** The process starts with a complex function, usually a polynomial. The most common function used is \( f(z) = z^2 + c \), where \( z \) and \( c \) are complex numbers.

2. **Iterative Process:** The heart of generating a Julia set is an iterative process. You start with a complex number \( z \) (which corresponds to a point on the complex plane), apply the function to it, and then feed the result back into the function. This process is repeated many times.

3. **Initial Value of \( z \):** The initial value of \( z \) is typically varied across a grid of points that represent the pixels of the image. Each point on this grid corresponds to a different complex number.

4. **Determining the Fate of Each Point:** As you iterate the function, one of two things can happen:
    - The values remain bounded within a certain distance from the origin. If this happens, the point is considered to be part of the Julia set.
    - The values start to escape towards infinity. In this case, the point is not part of the Julia set.

5. **Color Coding:** To visualize the set, each point on the plane is colored according to how quickly the values reach a certain threshold (a point where it's considered that the values will head towards infinity). Points that stay within the threshold for more iterations are usually given one color, while those that escape more quickly are given another.

6. **Fractal Nature:** The resulting image often displays intricate and infinitely complex patterns. Even when you zoom into a Julia set, you can find similar patterns at every scale, which is a hallmark of fractals.

7. **Choice of \( c \):** The appearance of the Julia set can dramatically change with different values of \( c \). Some values produce connected sets, while others produce a dust of disconnected points.

8. **Computer Graphics:** In practice, creating visualizations of Julia sets requires significant computational power, especially for high-resolution images. Computers iterate the function for each pixel and assign colors based on the iteration count.

Julia sets are not only mathematically fascinating but also produce stunningly beautiful images, bridging the gap between mathematics and art.
